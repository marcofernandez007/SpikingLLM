## The assumptions made in the nengo implementation: 

Okay, let's expand the example to move closer to a "real LLM" direction. It's crucial to reiterate that we are still not building a fully functional spiking LLM in Nengo. That's a massive research undertaking. Instead, we'll focus on:

Using Pre-trained Word Embeddings: Real LLMs use word embeddings to represent semantic meaning. We'll incorporate pre-trained embeddings (like GloVe or Word2Vec) to give our Nengo network a sense of word meaning.

More Realistic Parsing (Optional but Recommended): We'll leverage spaCy (or similar libraries) to get more linguistically informed parse trees. This will give the Nengo network a more structured input.

Conceptual Connection to Transformer-like Mechanisms: We'll discuss how the Nengo network, even in a simplified form, can conceptually relate to aspects of Transformer architectures, particularly in representing hierarchical relationships.

Highlighting the Challenges and Future Directions: We'll clearly outline the immense gap that still exists and what research directions are needed to move towards true spiking LLMs.



## The conclusions: 

Key Improvements and Explanations in the Expanded Code:

Pre-trained Word Embeddings (GloVe):

gensim library: We use the gensim library to easily download and load pre-trained GloVe word embeddings. You can choose other embedding models (Word2Vec, FastText) if you prefer.

get_word_embedding function: This function retrieves the embedding for a given word from the GloVe model. If a word is not found in GloVe's vocabulary, it returns a random vector as a fallback (you might want to handle out-of-vocabulary words more robustly in a real application).

Embedding Dimension: The embedding_dimension variable now stores the dimensionality of the GloVe embeddings (typically 50, 100, 200, or 300).

Nengo Ensemble Dimensions: In nengo_llm_parse_tree_network, the dimensions of each nengo.Ensemble is increased to dimensions_per_node + embedding_dim. This means each ensemble now represents both aspects:

dimensions_per_node: Still used for representing the structural aspect of the parse tree node (like its position in the hierarchy).

embedding_dim: Used to represent the semantic meaning of the word using the pre-trained word embedding.

Input Node for Embeddings: For each word node, a nengo.Node is created to feed the pre-trained word embedding into the embedding dimensions of the corresponding nengo.Ensemble using nengo.Connection(input_node, ensemble[:embedding_dim]). This sets the initial representation of word meaning in the Nengo network.

More Realistic Parse Trees (spaCy):

generate_realistic_parse_tree function: This function now uses spaCy to perform dependency parsing on the input text.

Richer Parse Tree Structure: The parse tree dictionary now includes:

token: The word itself.

pos: Part-of-speech tag (e.g., "NOUN," "VERB," "DET").

dep: Dependency relation (e.g., "ROOT," "det," "obj").

children: A list of child nodes, recursively building the tree.

Dependency Parsing: spaCy's dependency parser tries to identify grammatical relationships between words in a sentence, giving a more linguistically meaningful structure than the very basic SVO assumption in the previous example.

nengo_llm_parse_tree_network Function (Updated):

create_node_ensemble_with_embedding: This helper function is introduced to create ensembles that handle both structural dimensions and embedding dimensions.

_recursive_build_network: The recursive function is adapted to work with the richer spaCy parse tree structure and to connect parent nodes to child nodes, still in a simplified hierarchical manner. The connections now target the non-embedding dimensions of the child ensembles (ensemble[embedding_dim:]), while the embedding dimensions are set by the input nodes.

Example Usage (More Complex Sentences):

The example input_prompt and output_text are changed to more complex sentences to better demonstrate the realistic parsing and embedding aspects.

pprint is used to pretty-print the more complex parse trees for better readability.

Clearer "Gaps and Future Directions" Section:

The code now includes a much more explicit section that emphasizes the huge gaps that remain between this example and a real LLM.

It outlines key future research directions needed to bridge this gap, including: spiking attention, learning, efficiency, output generation, and hybrid approaches.

Limitations and Why This Is Still Not a "Spiking LLM":

Representation, Not Generation: This Nengo network is primarily designed to represent the structure and semantic meaning of input text. It does not perform text generation, next-word prediction, or other core LLM tasks.

Simplified Connections and No Learning: The connections between nodes in the Nengo network are still very basic and hand-designed. Real LLMs learn incredibly complex connection patterns from massive datasets. There is no learning mechanism implemented in this Nengo example.

No Attention Mechanisms: Attention mechanisms are central to the power of Transformers and modern LLMs. This example does not incorporate any form of attention.

Efficiency and Scalability: Spiking neural networks, in their current form, are not as computationally efficient as standard deep learning architectures (like Transformers) for large-scale language tasks. Scaling this approach to the size of real LLMs is a major research challenge.

Output Generation Challenge: A fundamental question is: How would you get a spiking neural network like this to generate coherent text? Decoding spiking activity back into words is a very complex problem.

Moving Towards a True Spiking LLM is a Long-Term Research Goal:

This expanded example is still a simplified conceptual exploration. Building a truly functional, large-scale spiking neuron LLM is a very challenging and long-term research goal. It requires significant advances in:

Spiking Neuron Architectures: Designing more powerful and efficient spiking neuron network architectures that can perform complex computations like attention and sequence modeling.

Spiking Learning Algorithms: Developing effective learning algorithms for training large spiking neural networks on language tasks.

Hardware and Software: Creating specialized hardware and software tools that can efficiently simulate and run large spiking neural networks.

Theoretical Understanding: Gaining a deeper theoretical understanding of how spiking neural networks can represent and process complex information like language.

This expanded example is a stepping stone towards exploring these exciting research directions, but it's important to be realistic about the current limitations.
